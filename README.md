# yetanotherhyprland-dotfiles

I only provided the dotfiles to achieve a similar look , please configure to your needs.
do not download the entire repo and use it as ur hyprland dotfiles , it might not work since i didnt include everything here.

please dont break you system. if anything isnt working feel free to open a issue
